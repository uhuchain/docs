# Motivation 
We are technology and insurance experts and we would like to challenge the blockchain technology within the insurance business. 
But instead of just developing a 'Hello World Something' we would like to act as if we will found a new company and/or Open Source Project. Possibly our 'training' approach is so successfull that we can leave the prototype and training path sometimes in the future for bigger plans. If not we have learned at least about hyperledger,blockchain and its limitations.
